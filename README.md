# Emails of Encouragement

Front-end work is hard; many people avoid it if they can.

That's why we need to let our front-end devs know they're appreciated.

Use this script to send an email to your dev with a cheerful message about how great the website's looking.

To run:
1. Install File::Slurp: ```sudo cpan File::Slurp Email::MIME Email::Sender``` (these will take a while)
2. Fill out the files *to_email.txt*, *from_email.txt* with the email to send to and from, respectively
3. Run the script ```perl emailer.pl```
